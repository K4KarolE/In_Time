## GIF image creation and how it is used in the animation
- The GIF images are generated in `DaVinci Resolve`:
    - On the Deliver page:
        - Format: GIF
        - Codec: Animated GIF
        - Resolution: 720 x 486 NTSC
- `PyQt6`:
    - The GIF/animation playback is handled by `PyQt's` own `QMovie` module
- `Tkinter`:
    - Image objects are created from the GIF via DIY in the app
    - The returning phase of the movements in the animation are not part of the GIF images
    - It is coming from allocating the same image object for 2 mirrored positions in the image sequence/list:
        - half sized GIF images, faster load time

- The current GIF images are tailored for the faster `PyQt` version
